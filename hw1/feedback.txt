Quicksort that uses middle index as pivot is acceptable and has good efficiency.

You're not doing any unnecessary sorting. However median and quartiles don't require the whole array to be sorted. (nth_element)

Your program leaks memory (memory reserved with new is never freed with delete)

You could make only one quicksort function that takes the comparing function as a parameter.
